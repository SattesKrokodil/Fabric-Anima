## [3.0.0] - Update to 1.18.1

- Had to remove some, added some - but with "betteranimalsplus" and their millions of animals, and the wildlife mod Anima is finally what it always wanted to be. 

## [2.0.3] - Changelog
### Information
- All soul descriptions ("Pick your animal soul screen/origins") will get a rework once the new origins update is there. (scrollbar, hover-over badges, ...) it will stay chaotic till then, I don't want to do double work if it's so close)

### General Stuff

- added some missing enchantment descriptions

- Tooltip fix (enchantment descriptions should be readable now)
- Statement (lib/dep)
- Vanilla Degus (new critter!)
- Towlette (more things are waterlogable)
